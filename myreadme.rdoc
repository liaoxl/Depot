# My person notes when learning the book < Agile Web Development with Rails>

# Problem 1
Page 134:
	When I finished the revising of line_items_controller.rb
	I click the "add to cart" button 
	A error occurred
	
## Like this :
	ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::Error in LineItemsController#create

	Canâ€™t mass-assign protected attributes: product

## I found the similar problems on http://forums.pragprog.com/forums/148/topics/10565

and I revise the file following this advice:

"I solved this problem (same rails version) by changing the build call to: build(:product_id => product.id). Same problem in the functional test."

and I get it solved
